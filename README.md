# Using-Machine-Learning-to-Classify-Iris-Flower-Datasets

This dataset classification project is based on the tutorial found at "https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/".  Being new to the field of machine learning, I just wanted to get a feel for how datasets are classified using various machine learning models.  I will provide the load_dataset.py file I made so that anyone can visualize the differences between the different machine learning models used in this project.  Enjoy!
